## XP values:

#### Courage--Xiaoting Jin:


#### Communication--Gaochao Wang:
I set up a wechat app group, where all team members can communicate using the mobile app. We also update our task progress, discuss problems on the platform and make plan for next tasks. I talked with each member every day or two to get to know their progress and coordiate to meet and work together, and make sure everyone is on the same page with every progress.  


#### Simplicity

#### Feedback--Yuxiang Chen:
Ever since we started the project, we have held regular meetings every week as well as meetings as needed during our free time to discuss the project and everyone's progress. We listen to each other and constantly adept our approach to accomplish the project. Over the past weeks of hard working, we have been changing UI, adapting different technology, like web socket, by hearing feedbacks from each other.
